# **Do You Dare?**

An ultra-minimal, neo-brutalist, black-and-white confession website — featuring the legendary *un-clickable* NO button.

This project asks one simple question:

> **Do you wanna be my girlfriend?**  
> **Yes** — works normally  
> **No** — teleports away forever.

## 💡 Idea  
This project started as a simple question — but with a twist.  
The goal was to create the *most brutally minimal*, pencil-sketched, black-and-white “confession site” ever…  
**except the NO button refuses to cooperate.**  

The concept mixes:  
- neo-brutalism  
- sketchbook aesthetics  
- playful chaos  
- and a bit of emotional damage  

The result?  
A website that looks innocent and handmade,  
but behaves like it has *trust issues*.
